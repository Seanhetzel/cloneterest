# C L O N E T E R E S T
# This is an MVP idea board for images much like Pinterest. 
Currently, a user can:
1. Paste an image URL, give it a name and description and add it to the board. 
2. Delete images from the board.

The images are ordered from newest to oldest in descending order. They are organized in a masonry layout of 4 columns. 

# Future features:
1. Create an account and log in.
2. Be able to Like an image and have it saved to your favorites. 
3. Be able to comment on an image.
4. Be able to share the image with social media buttons.
5. Be able to upload an image from your computer instead of pasting a link.
6. Add an option to sort the images from most liked to least liked in descending order.
7. Deploy on Heroku

# Please feel free to implement any of these features or add more.
