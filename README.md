# This is an idea board for images much like Pinterest. 
Currently, a user can:
1. Paste an image URL, give it a name and description and add it to the board. 
2. Delete images from the board.

The images are ordered from newest to oldest in descending order. They are organized in a masonry layout of 4 columns. 

# To do:
1. Create an account and log in.
2. Be able to Like an image and have it saved to your favorites. 
3. Be able to comment on an image.
4. Be able to share the image with social media buttons.
x. Be able to upload an image from your computer instead of pasting a link.
6. Add error message when URL input in form is left blank.
7. Add an option to sort the images from most liked to least liked in descending order.
x. Change db that is compatible with Heroku
x. Deploy to Heroku

# Bugs:
[x] render pin to frontend when added and remove it from front end when deleted
[ ] consider changing image sizing method
